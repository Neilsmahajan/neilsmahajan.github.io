          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            I chose to create a miniature word guessing game for my honor's
            project named Word Scramble. The game has one player who must guess
            a word from the scrambled version of that word. My motivation for
            creating this game was to create something useful and interesting to
            me. By creating a game that sparks the player to think and
            contemplate a guess, it invites the player to get involved with the
            game and through the variety of words and genres, continue playing.
            Additionally, this game is a short-time-killer type of game, which
            means anyone could get an understanding of how to play very quickly
            and begin playing. The creation of Word Scramble also requires me to
            implement the concepts of object-oriented programming, sorting, GUI
            development, and game creation.
          </p>
          <h2>Requirements</h2>
          <p>
            The requirements for this Word Scramble game will be to provide an
            application and interface where the player can play the game in the
            most efficient, practical, simple, and enjoyable format. Therefore,
            the game will only contain the necessary elements but will provide
            an eye-pleasing display with separated and easy-to-read elements.
            The interface of the game will also be straightforward with the
            buttons' intentions labeled clearly and removing any confusion a
            player would have while playing.
          </p>
          <h2>Approach</h2>
          <p>
            My approach was to scratch up the basic details of the project
            including the use case, actors, and steps of execution. I also
            created a basic sketch of what the game could look like so that I
            have a basic reference point for creating the game. After figuring
            out what objects I would create, I created a UML diagram and
            included the relationships between the objects while creating the
            instance variables and methods for each object.
          </p>
          <h2>Steps of Execution</h2>
          <p>
            1. The user chooses a word bank<br />
            2. A random word is chosen from the selected word bank<br />
            3. The current word bank text is updated<br />
            4. The original word is scrambled<br />
            5. The scrambled word is shown on the screen<br />
            6. When the player presses the hint button, a random letter from the
            word is shown in the correct position and the score is decreased<br />
            7. The player attempts to guess the word<br />
            8. The number of guesses count is increased and displayed<br />
            9. The player submits and the answer is compared to the unscrambled
            word checking to see if they are the same<br />
            10. If they are the same, a congratulations message is displayed,
            the number of words guessed count and number of guesses count is set
            to zero, the score increases, and the player chooses a new word from
            a word bank<br />
            11. If they are not the same, an incorrect guess message is
            displayed, the number of guesses counts increases, the score
            decreases, and the player can choose a new word or guess again<br />
            12. When the player chooses a word bank from the drop-down and
            clicks the new word button, it checks to see if the previous word
            was guessed or not<br />
            13. If it was not guessed, then the number of words not guessed
            count increases, and the score decreases<br />
            14. A new word is chosen from the selected word bank, and the
            instruction message is displayed, the current word bank text is
            updated, and the word object is set to play again
          </p>

          <h2>Simulation</h2>
          <p>Game Start</p>
          <span class="image"><img src="images/WSPicture1.png" alt="" /></span>
          <p>
            Incorrect Guess: provides incorrect guess message, decreases score,
            increases the number of guesses count, and displays the word in
            previous guesses
          </p>
          <span class="image"><img src="images/WSPicture2.png" alt="" /></span>
          <p>
            The player presses the hint button: a randomly selected letter in
            the word is revealed in the correct order under revealed letters and
            the score is decreased
          </p>
          <span class="image"><img src="images/WSPicture3.png" alt="" /></span>
          <p>
            The player guesses the word correctly: the congratulations message
            shows, the number of words guessed count increases, the score
            increases, the correct word is displayed, and the input text box is
            cleared and set to not editable
          </p>
          <span class="image"><img src="images/WSPicture4.png" alt="" /></span>
          <p>
            The Player chooses a new word after selecting a word bank: the
            number of words not guessed is updated increased and the score is
            decreased if the word was not guessed, and a new word from the
            selected word bank is provided and scrambled to display to the
            player
          </p>
          <span class="image"><img src="images/WSPicture5.png" alt="" /></span>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            When creating this project, I faced a few problems that included
            figuring out how the border pane worked in JavaFX along with how to
            make the application well presented and organized. By overcoming
            these problems and creating a java project from scratch, I gained a
            greater understanding of java object-oriented programming. I think
            the greatest task that helped me with this project was contemplating
            and designing the objects and their relations using a
            step-of-execution list and a UML diagram indicating the
            relationships between the objects. From that point on, I coded the
            project without changing my basic design too much other than
            optimizing and eliminating some unnecessary objects and variables
            while adding one or two that allowed me to complete my vision for
            the game. Some possible improvements that could be made in the
            future include adding more color to the game to draw the player’s
            eyes to a certain message or area. This color would aid in the
            visual appeal of the game and would increase the player’s interest
            in the game. I could also improve the complexity of the game, by
            adding more word banks and additional settings in a separate pane
            screen to access and control features such as difficulty or score.
