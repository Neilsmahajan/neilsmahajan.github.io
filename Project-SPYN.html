          <h2>Description of Project</h2>
          <p>
            The requirements for this project were to create a car which could
            solve the maze autonomously without user control unless it was on
            the green and blue areas, where the user had control of the car
            which surved the purpose of a taxi. The car picked a miniature inch
            by inch cardbord wheelchaired man on blue and dropped off the
            cardboard wheelchair man on the green without harming the man.
            Additionally the car should start on yellow and stop on the red stop
            signs indicated with red tape on the ground.
          </p>
          <h2>Car Design</h2>
          <p>
            We created the design of the car with the goals to maximize the
            car's compactness and sturdieness while fitting all of the motors
            and the sensors which connected to the EV3 brick. Throughout the
            testing phase of the process, the car encountered multiple issues
            with getting stuck at certain parts of the maze such as the corners
            where a pertruding sensor catch the edge of the wall and move the
            car in an incorrect direciton. Additionally, because of the way the
            bumper sensor on the front of the car could hit the wall on its edge
            and hault the car without even registering the press, the car could
            get stuck even with a slight misalignement of direction. To solve
            both of these issues, our team added small wheels with an axis
            perpendicular to the ground on both the left and right sides not
            only so that the car wouldn't get stuck on the corners, but also so
            the robot's bumper sensor would always activate when heading towards
            a wall even with a large misalignment.
          </p>
          <h2>Programming</h2>
          <p>
            Our solution to solving the maze was to have the car hug the right
            wall until arriving at a portion requiring user control. The car
            used the inputs from ultrasonic sensor to determine when it should
            turn right, the bumper sensor on the front to determine when it
            should turn left, and the color sensor to determine when it should
            switch over to user control. We faced issues with the code through
            inconsistancies such as the car not turning exactly ninty degrees
            due to the way the MATLAB language funcitoned. We fixed this issue
            through redesigning the car itself so that it would account for the
            inperecise turnes along with changing the code so that the car would
            not enter an infinite loop, rendering it stuck, while traversing
            through the maze.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            I learned many skills through the creation of the project such as
            debugging code and trouble shooting issues along with designing a
            robot. Beyond those skills, I gained experience in many soft skills
            such as teamwork and communication. Although our team faced many
            issues during the development stage requiring us to redesign the car
            after it accidentally fell from a table, we were able to
            successfully create an autonomous car that can solve a maze.
